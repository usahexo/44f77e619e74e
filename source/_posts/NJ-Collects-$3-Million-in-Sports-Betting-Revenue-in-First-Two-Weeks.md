#  NJ Collects $3 Million in Sports Betting Revenue in First Two Weeks

On July 26, New Jersey collected $3 million of sports betting revenue in its first two weeks of operation. This is a strong start for the state and marks the fifth straight month of increasing gambling revenue. Tax revenue from sports betting is expected to reach $120 million this year, up from the initial estimate of $60 million.

Sports betting has been available in New Jersey since June 14, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. New Jersey was among six states that had been waiting for the high court’s decision.

The NFL’s preseason opener on August 9 was among the first sporting events to be legal to bet on in New Jersey. More than $16 million was wagered on that game alone, with the New York Jets beating the Atlanta Falcons 17-0.

In total, nearly $300 million has been wagered on sports in New Jersey since legalization. The vast majority of this (86%) has been wagered through online platforms, with only 14% being placed through Atlantic City casino sports books.

Atlantic City casino operators are hoping to see a boost in business now that sports betting is legal. So far, there hasn’t been much of a change, with casino gaming revenue down 2% in July YoY . Sports betting could help revive interest in casino gaming, but it’s too early to tell at this point.

Other states that have legalized sports betting have also seen increases in gambling revenue. In Pennsylvania, for example, gambling revenue was up 18% in July compared to the same month last year . This increase is largely due to new casinos opening up earlier this year, but it’s still a good sign for the industry overall.

#  NJ Officials Expecting Billions in Sports Betting Revenue

After the Supreme Court struck down a 26-year ban on sports betting on Monday, officials in New Jersey are expecting a windfall of revenue.

Governor Phil Murphy has said that he expects sports betting to generate up to $500 million in revenue for the state over the next four years. That estimate may be low, as other states are also preparing to capitalize on the new law.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) predicts that nationwide sports betting could bring in more than $6 billion in annual revenue.

That would make it a significant source of income for states, which would be able to use the money to fund education, infrastructure projects, or other priorities.

“This is great news for New Jersey and its residents, who can now enjoy a product that has been enjoyed illegally for years,” Governor Murphy said.

Gambling is currently legal in New Jersey at casinos and racetracks, but Monday’s ruling allows sports betting at other locations, including bars and restaurants.

The state is expected to begin taking bets within two weeks.

#  NJ Seeing Huge Growth in Online Sports Betting

New Jersey has seen a significant uptick in online sports betting activity in the past year, as the state has moved to legalize the practice.

According to figures from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement released this week, the state took in nearly $2.9 billion in sports bets in 2018. That’s up from just over $1.1 billion in 2017, when only bets on horse races were legal.

In December alone, New Jerseyans placed more than $385 million worth of sports bets, up from about $325 million in December 2017.

Online sports betting was legalized in New Jersey in June 2018, and the state has since seen a surge in popularity for the practice. In November 2018 alone, nearly $318 million worth of sports bets were placed through internet and mobile channels, accounting for more than 54% of all statewide wagers.

The increase in online betting has been a boon to Atlantic City’s casino industry. Bets placed online generate much higher profits for casinos than those placed at physical sportsbooks, because there are no overhead costs associated with setting up and staffing a physical location.

Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Entertainment - which operates three Atlantic City casinos - credited the growth in online betting for helping to offset declines in gaming revenue at its properties last year.

“The increase in internet gaming is helping to offset some of the softness we are seeing on the casino floor from other gaming jurisdictions,” Rodio said earlier this year.

Casino revenue across Atlantic City was down 3.6% last year, according to figures from the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. But casinos profits from internet gambling were up nearly 20%, helped by the growth in online sports betting.
