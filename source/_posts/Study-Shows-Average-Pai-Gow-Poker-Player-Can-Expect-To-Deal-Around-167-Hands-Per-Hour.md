#  Study Shows Average Pai Gow Poker Player Can Expect To Deal Around 167 Hands Per Hour

When playing Pai Gow Poker, you can usually expect to deal around 167 hands per hour. This is according to a recent study that was conducted by a team of experts at the University of Nevada. The study also found that the average player can expect to lose around $2.50 per hour while playing the game.

While Pai Gow Poker is not as popular as other casino games, it can still be a lot of fun to play. This is especially true if you are able to find a table where the minimum bet is low. In general, the lower the minimum bet, the slower the game will move. This gives you more time to make decisions and increases your chances of winning.

If you are new to Pai Gow Poker, there are a few things that you need to know before you start playing. The first thing is that the game is played with two poker decks, which are mixed together before each hand is dealt. The second thing is that players are dealt seven cards, which they must divide into two hands – a five-card hand and a two-card hand. The third thing is that both hands must rank higher than any of the dealer’s hands in order for the player to win.

One common strategy for playing Pai Gow Poker is to always split your cards into two separate hands. This will give you the best chance of winning, even if your two-card hand isn’t very strong. You can also try splitting your cards if you have four low cards or if you have three high cards and one low card. However, you should never split your cards if you have two pairs or if you have three of a kind.

If you want to increase your chances of winning at Pai Gow Poker, it’s important to understand the different beats that can occur in the game. The most common beat is called “the house way”, which occurs when the dealer has a higher five-card hand than your five-card hand. Other beats include when your two-card hand beats the dealer’s two-card hand (called “the player way”) and when your five-card hand beats the dealer’s five-card hand (called “the bank way”).

#  Pai Gow Poker Players Can Expect To Deal More Than 160 Hands Per Hour On Average

When playing Pai Gow Poker online, the average player can expect to deal more than 160 hands per hour. That number may seem a little daunting, but with a strategy in place, it is definitely achievable.

The first step to dealing more hands is to be aware of the game's fast pace. When players are seated at the table, they should be ready to act as soon as it is their turn. This means having chips in front of them and being familiar with the betting options.

In addition to being quick on their feet, players will also need to be decisive with their hands. Since there are only two cards to work with, it is important to make the most of them. This means knowing when to fold and when to bet big.

While luck still plays a significant role in Pai Gow Poker, having a strong strategy will give players an edge over the competition. Those who are willing to put in the time necessary to learn the ropes will undoubtedly see better results at the table.

#  Research Shows That Pai Gow Poker Players Dealt An Average Of 158 Hands Per Hour

According to a study recently published in the “Journal of Gambling Studies,” players of Pai Gow Poker dealt an average of 158 hands per hour in live casino play. The study also found that more experienced players dealt more hands per hour than novice players.

The research was conducted by a team of four casino industry professionals, all of whom have experience in both Pai Gow Poker and casino management. The aim of the study was to better understand the playing habits of Pai Gow Poker players, with a view to improving overall game efficiency and providing a better gaming experience for players.

The study found that the average player dealt 158 hands per hour, with the most experienced players dealing around 180 hands per hour. In contrast, novice players dealt an average of just 132 hands per hour. This suggests that as players become more experienced, they are able to deal more hands per hour and achieve a higher level of profitability.

Interestingly, while the average hand dealt was 9.48 cards, only 3.48 cards were actually used in play on average. This indicates that many hands are being folded pre-flop, leading to less action and more waiting time for players at the table.

The study also looked at how long it took players to make their decision on each hand. It found that the majority of decisions (57 percent) were made within two seconds, while only 10 percent required more than 10 seconds to make a decision. This indicates that Pai Gow Poker is a relatively fast-paced game, with most decisions being made quickly and without much deliberation.

So what do these findings mean for casino operators? They suggest that dealers should be dealing around 180 hands per hour in order to match the pace set by experienced players. They also indicate that casinos should consider offering fast-fold variants of Pai Gow Poker in order to keep gameplay moving along at a brisk pace.

#  Poker Provence : Dealing at an average of 168 hands per hour, pai gow poker is one of the fastest games in the casino !

Whether you’re a seasoned pai gow poker player or are just looking to learn the game, Poker Provence has everything you need to get started. In this article, we will discuss the basics of the game – from hand rankings to strategy.

# The Basics

In pai gow poker, players are dealt seven cards, which they then use to create two poker hands – one five-card hand and one two-card hand. The goal is to create the strongest possible hands using both of your cards and any of the five community cards.

The five community cards are placed in the middle of the table, and players can use them to complete either of their hands. The rank of each hand is determined by comparing the highest card in each hand; if both hands have the same high card, then the second-highest card is used, and so on.

Here’s an example: Suppose you are dealt two kings, a three, a four, a six and an eight. You would create two hands – a king-high straight flush (A-2-3-4-5) and two pair (king-queen). Your king-high straight flush would beat your two pair.

# Hand Rankings

Below is a list of the hand rankings in pai gow poker, from strongest to weakest:

Straight flush – Five consecutive cards of the same suit.

Four of a kind – Four cards of the same rank.

#  How To Deal Pai Gow Poker - Learn How Many Hands You'll Deal Per Hour

When playing pai gow poker, there are a few things that you need to bear in mind in order to make the most of the game. One such consideration is how many hands you will deal each hour.

This number will partly depend on the speed of your opponents, and also how comfortable you feel dealing more hands per hour. It is generally recommended that beginners start with around 10-12 hands per hour, but you may find that you want to deal more or fewer as you gain experience.

In order to help you calculate how many hands you'll be dealing each hour, we've put together a handy guide.

If You're Dealing at a Casino:

The average time for a dealer to deal one hand is approximately 15 seconds. This means that in an hour, a dealer can theoretically deal around 40 hands. However, other factors such as breaks and shuffling will affect this number.

If You're Dealing at Home:

At home, you may find that it takes a little longer to deal each hand. A reasonable estimate would be around 30 seconds per hand, which would give you around 20 hands per hour. Again, this may vary depending on your circumstances.
