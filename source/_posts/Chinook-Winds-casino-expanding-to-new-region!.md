#  Chinook Winds casino expanding to new region!

The Chinook Winds casino is expanding to a new region, according to officials from the casino. The new region is the central United States, and the casino is expecting to open its doors in late 2019.

The new location will be in Kansas City, Missouri, and it will be the first casino in the state. The casino will offer a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker. In addition, there will be a hotel on site with 400 rooms.

Chinook Winds CEO Brian Sutton says that the decision to expand to Kansas City was based on population growth in the area. "The Midwest is growing rapidly and we saw an opportunity to bring our world-class entertainment and gaming to this region," Sutton said in a statement.

He also noted that the company has been looking for a new location for quite some time. "We have been evaluating potential locations for several years and believe that Kansas City is a perfect market for our brand."

Kansas City Mayor Sly James was also excited about the news. "This is great news for Kansas City," he said. "Chinook Winds is a top-notch operation and will be a huge boost to our economy."

#  Chinook Winds casino expanding their services!

The Chinook Winds casino is expanding their services to include a new hotel and convention center! This is great news for the area, as it will bring in more tourism and revenue. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2020, and will add 400 jobs to the local economy.

This is not the first time that Chinook Winds has expanded; they have previously added a new restaurant, bar, and conference space. The casino is also adding a new sports book, which is sure to be popular among gamblers.

The expansion is part of a larger trend in the gaming industry; casinos are increasingly adding hotels and other non-gaming amenities in order to attract more customers. This makes sense, as the gambling market is becoming increasingly competitive.

It will be interesting to see how the new Chinook Winds casino performs. Iâ€™m sure that it will be a major success, as the casino has already proven itself to be a valuable asset to the community. Thanks for investing in our area, Chinook Winds!

#  Casino mogul expands his empire with new Chinook Winds casino!

It was a big week for casino mogul Gary Loveman. On Tuesday, the Crown Resorts Limited (ASX:CWN) announced that its chairman, Gary Loveman, has resigned from the board. The next day, it was revealed that his company, Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ:CZR) had reached an agreement to purchase the Chinook Winds Casino Resort in Lincoln City, Oregon for $82 million.

The new property will be Caesars' first casino on the West Coast of the United States. It will also be the company's eleventh overall property in the state of Oregon. According to a statement released by Caesars, the resort will feature 605 rooms and suites, a spa, 36,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, multiple restaurants and bars, and a retail promenade. The property is expected to open in late 2020.

"Chinook Winds is an attractive opportunity given its location on the Oregon Coast near both Portland and Salem," said Tony Rodio, president and CEO of Caesars Entertainment. "The addition of Chinook Winds will complement our existing portfolio and further expand our reach into new markets."

The move comes as Loveman continues to expand his empire beyond Atlantic City and Las Vegas. In recent years he has been focusing on acquisitions outside of those two markets in an effort to reduce the company's reliance on those two areas.

Shares of Crown Resorts were up slightly following the news of Loveman's resignation but have since retreated and are currently down 1 percent year-to-date. Shares of Caesars Entertainment were up 2 percent following the announcement but have also since retreated and are currently down 3 percent year-to-date.
