#  Why You Should Stick to 20 Numbers in Blackjack

There are a lot of myths and old wives tales when it comes to gambling, but one of the most persistent is that you should never split 10s in blackjack. In fact, this is bad advice that can lead to you losing more money.

The reasoning behind this myth is that 10 is the best hand you can have in blackjack, so splitting them makes them weaker. However, splitting 10s actually gives you two chances to make a strong hand, instead of just one.

For example, if you are dealt two 10s, you could split them and then draw two more cards each for a 20. Or, if the dealer has a weak card showing (3 through 6), you could hit your hand and hope to get 21. By splitting 10s, you give yourself more options and increase your chances of winning.

In general, you should always split Aces and 8s, and hit on any other hand. This will give you the best chance of winning at blackjack.

#  Playing With 21 Could Cost You Your Winnings

If you're like most people, you enjoy playing the lottery from time to time. After all, who wouldn't want to win millions of dollars with just a tiny investment? But what if we told you that playing with 21 could actually cost you your winnings?

 Believe it or not, this is actually something that happens fairly often. Players will purchase tickets with numbers that are close to 21 and end up losing because of it. In fact, in some cases, the players might have even won if they hadn't chosen such risky numbers.

So why is playing with 21 such a bad idea? For starters, 21 is the most commonly drawn number in the lottery. This means that there is a good chance that at least one other ticket in the draw will also have this number. As a result, any prize money you might win would be shared with others – and it's likely that you would get far less than you would have if you'd chosen another number.

In addition, 21 is also a very risky number to choose because it's so close to blackjack's key number of 22. This means that casinos are more likely to spot people who are playing with 21 and take appropriate action – which could include confiscating their winnings.

Ultimately, while playing with 21 might seem like a fun way to improve your chances of winning the lottery, it's actually not worth the risk. There are much safer ways to boost your odds, so stick to those instead!

#  Counting Cards at 21 is a Recipe for Disaster

Most people think that counting cards at a blackjack table is a foolproof way to ensure they walk away a winner. However, this is not the case – in fact, counting cards at 21 can be a recipe for disaster.

There are a few things to keep in mind when counting cards at 21. For starters, it’s important to remember that the count is only as accurate as your last hands. So, if you have a strong hand, make sure to update your count accordingly.

Additionally, it’s important to be aware of the other players at the table. If you are spotted counting cards, the casino may bar you from playing blackjack altogether. So, it’s important to be subtle when counting cards and only do so when you are alone at the table.

Finally, remember that even if you are using a card counting system correctly, there is no guarantee you will win money in the long run. In fact, you may even end up losing money. So, always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose.

#  Play Wisely and Stick to 20 Numbers in Blackjack 

If you have never played blackjack before, it is important to understand the basic rules of the game before playing. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (also known as a blackjack), or by having a higher total point score than the dealer, without exceeding 21.

To play blackjack, you will need a basic understanding of addition and subtraction, as well as an understanding of what constitutes a winning hand. In blackjack, the Ace is both a high and low card, and can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes the best hand. The other numbered cards are worth their face value, while all picture cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each.

The most important rule to remember when playing blackjack is that you must not exceed 21 points with your first two cards - if you do, you "bust" and automatically lose the hand. In addition, remember that the dealer must also hit on 16 and stand on 17.

Below are three simple tips to help beginners improve their chances of winning at blackjack:

1) Play wisely and stick to 20 numbers. This will help reduce your chances of busting.

2) Always take insurance if the dealer has an Ace up. This will protect you in case the dealer gets a blackjack.

3) Remember to split pairs (e.g. two eights or two kings) when applicable in order to increase your chances of winning more money.

#  Keep it Simple: 20 Numbers for Successful Blackjack Play

1. Know your odds.

This is key to playing blackjack successfully. The better you understand the odds, the more you can adjust your betting and playing strategy to give yourself the best possible chance of winning.

2. Start with a small bet.

Especially when you're first starting out, it's important not to make too big a bet and lose too much money right away. Start small and increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the game.

3. Stay within your bankroll.

Don't bet more than you can afford to lose - that's just asking for trouble. Stick to the amount of money you've set aside specifically for playing blackjack, and don't go over that limit.

4. Use basic strategy charts.

These handy guides will help you make the best decisions when it comes to your betting and playing strategies. Knowing when to hit, stand, double down, or split can mean the difference between winning and losing money.

5. Don't get greedy!

It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a hot streak and start making bigger and bigger bets, but remember that sooner or later that luck is going to run out - so don't blow your whole bankroll on one hand!
7 numbers on a Blackjack table

 6 Double Down: When you have a good hand (11 or 12), doubling down allows you to place an additional bet equal to your original wager, in exchange for just one more card from the dealer.. This is a risky move - if you bust (go over 21), you lose both bets - but it can also be extremely lucrative if it pays off.. 8 Split: When you have two cards of equal value (two eights, two fives, etc.), splitting them allows you to place an additional bet on each card and play them as separate hands.. If both hands end up winning, you'll receive double payouts - but if either hand loses, you lose the entire bet..  9 Hit: When your first two cards total less than 17, hit means taking another card from the dealer in hopes of getting closer to 21.. 10 Stand: If waiting for another card won't improve your hand (or will actually make it worse), stand means sticking with what you've got.. This is generally a safer option than hitting - especially if your hand is close to 21 already.. 11 Insurance: This optional side bet pays out 2-1 if the dealer has blackjack.. It's only worth making this wager if you feel very confident about your hand (and are willing not just to break even, but also potentially lose money).. 12 Bust: Going over 21 results in busting - and losing whatever amount of money you've wagered so far in that particular hand.. 13 Surrender: If things are looking particularly bleak early on in a hand (say, if your first two cards are an Ace and a six), surrendering allows you to give up half of your original stake and end the hand.. 14 Double down after splitting: Ifyou split two cards of matching rank (such as two Queens), and then draw another matching card on oneof those split hands,you can choosetoDoubleDownforbothhandsratherthanjustoneofthem.. 15 Dealer stands on soft 17: A "soft" 17 refers totwo differentcardcombinations which add upto17(e.g.,an Ace plus any6).Thedealerwillstandonall17s(bothhardandsoft)unlesstheyaretryingto pushthehandtoloseastraight17(i.e.,byhittingagainandsettingtheplayerover21). 16 No hole card: In some casinos - typically those outside of Las Vegas - the dealer doesn't take a "hole card" at the beginning of the round; instead they wait until all players have finished their hands before revealing their own hidden card and settling any winnings/losses.  17 Early payout: Some blackjack variants offer an early payoutoptioniftheplayerhasacertainhandqualification(usuallya pairofAcesormore).Thismeansthatiftheplayerchoosestoexitthegameinsteadofplayingontotheendofthehandortakinganothercardorsplittingpairstheywillreceiveafixedpercentageoftheirinitialstakeaswinningpayoutrightthenandthere." 18 Re-splitting pairs: Sometimes after splitting a pair of cards (two eights becomes four hands, for example), if another matching card is drawn onto oneofthose newlySplitpairs,youhavetheoptiontore-splitthemagainandyourbetwillnowbeplacedonthetwopokergamesyounowhold.(Note:Re-splitpairscannotbecombinedwithdoubledowns.) 19 5% commission : In most casinos ,thehouseedgeis2%-5%
