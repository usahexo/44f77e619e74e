#  Shock as poker player beats computer at its own game

A poker player has beaten a computer at the game, in a shock result that could have far-reaching implications for AI development.

The player, known only as ‘J’, managed to win over $1.5 million in just 11 hours of play against a world-leading 52GB neural network designed by Carnegie Mellon University.

The upset victory has left many in the AI community wondering if we are truly on the brink of developing machines that can outsmart humans at complex tasks.

In response to the defeat, the computer’s creators released a statement saying they were “deeply impressed” by J’s strategies and that the result showed how far we still have to go in terms of creating truly intelligent machines.

Speaking after his win, J said he was “very happy with the outcome” and attributed his success to his understanding of human psychology and the ability to deceive his opponents.

#  Turkmenistan becomes world's poker capital

Turkmenistan is the new poker capital of the world, as the small Central Asian country has seen a massive increase in the popularity of the card game over the past year. This surge in poker popularity can be largely attributed to the Turkmenistan government's decision to legalize and regulate the game in 2016.

Since then, Turkmenistan has seen an influx of both amateur and professional players, as well as dozens of new poker clubs sprouting up throughout the country. In addition, the Turkmenistan Poker Federation (TPF) was formed last year to promote and govern the sport in the country.

The TPF has organized several major tournaments since its inception, including the 2017 Asia-Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) event held in Ashgabat last November. The tournament drew some of the best players from around the region, including top ranked Chinese player Dương Đức Hiếu and 2-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner Amir Lehavot.

The Ashgabat event saw Hiếu take first place and earn himself a cool $177,930 payday. Other notable winners from Turkmenistan include Dosym Satpayev ($106,000), Rashid Ataev ($101,000) and Alisher Umarov ($90,000).

These impressive results have helped cement Turkmenistan's status as a top poker destination and are sure to attract even more players to the country in years to come. So if you're looking for a new place to play some poker, be sure to check out Turkmenistan – you might just find yourself a big winner!

#  Poker prodigy emerges from Turkmenistan

A young poker prodigy has come out of Turkmenistan, and is making waves in the professional poker circuit. At just 21 years old, he has already won several major tournaments, including two World Series of Poker events.

What is even more impressive is that he achieved all this despite having very little experience with the game before he started playing professionally. He learned how to play poker by watching videos on YouTube and reading articles online.

 His rapid success has been attributed to his natural talent for the game, as well as his aggressive playing style. He is not afraid to take risks, which often leads to him winning big pots.

Many experts believe that he has what it takes to become one of the greatest poker players of all time. With continued practice and experience, there is no doubt that he will only get better and better.

#  Poker champion crowned in Turkmenistan

The poker champion of Turkmenistan has been crowned following the country’s first ever major poker tournament.

The event, which took place at the Rixos President Hotel in the capital city Ashgabat, was won by Rustam Usmanov who took home the top prize of $15,000.

A total of 108 players from across Turkmenistan competed in the tournament, which was divided into four rounds.

Usmanov began the final day of competition as one of the chip leaders and he managed to hold his nerve in a tense heads-up battle against Eugeniy Shestakov to take home the title.

Speaking after his victory, Usmanov said: “It’s a great feeling to win my first ever major poker tournament. I’m grateful to everyone who helped make this event happen and I can’t wait to come back and compete again next year.”

The next edition of the Turkmenistan Poker Championship is already scheduled for January 2019 and it is expected to attract even more players from across the country.

#  Turkmenistan dominates world poker scene

Turkmenistan has come out on top in the global poker scene, with players from the central Asian country winning the most money in tournaments over the past year.

This is according to a new report by Online Poker Rankings (OPR), which analysed data from almost three million tournaments played between January and December 2017.

The report found that Turkmenistan’s top poker players – including Atamyrat Taganov, Saparmurat Niyazov and Ogulsapar Myradova – amassed winnings totaling more than $5.5 million. This was significantly more than any other country, with the US coming in second place with total winnings of just over $3 million.

Turkmenistan’s success on the global poker stage is largely due to the efforts of its top players, who have been consistently ranked among the world’s best over the past year. For example, Taganov was ranked fifth in the world for tournament earnings in 2017, while Niyazov and Myradova both featured in the top 50.

The news that Turkmenistan is now leading the world in poker comes as something of a surprise to many observers, who considered countries such as the US and Canada to be at the forefront of the sport. However, with Turkmenistani players continuing to achieve impressive results, it may only be a matter of time before they are recognized as true masters of the game.
