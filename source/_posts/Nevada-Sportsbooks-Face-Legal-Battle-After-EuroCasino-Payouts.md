#  Nevada Sportsbooks Face Legal Battle After EuroCasino Payouts

In what could be a landmark case for the legality of sports betting in the United States, legal experts are closely watching a dispute between Nevada casinos and a European online casino.

EuroCasino has paid out millions of dollars to bettors in Nevada, angering the state’s casinos who argue that the online casino is violating state law.

Nevada gaming law prohibits any casino from accepting bets placed outside of the state. The law is designed to protect Nevada’s casinos from competition by offshore gambling websites.

Casinos argue that EuroCasino is not licensed to operate in Nevada, and that the payouts represent an illegal gaming activity.

 EuroCasino has countered by arguing that its website is accessible to people in Nevada, and that it is not taking bets from residents of the state. The company also maintains that it is not operating as a casino, but as a bookmaker, which is legal under British law.

The case is currently being heard by a district court in Las Vegas. A decision is expected in the coming months.

If the court finds in favor of EuroCasino, it could open the door for other online casinos to offer their services to Americans players. It could also call into question the legality of sports betting in the United States.

#  Eighth Victim of EuroCasino Scam Files Suit

The eighth victim of what is being called a "EuroCasino scam" has filed suit, seeking restitution for the nearly $200,000 she lost in the scheme.

The scheme, which was exposed last month, saw players duped into depositing money on what they thought were online casino websites, only to have their funds disappear without a trace.

While the first seven victims of the scam have all been refunded by their banks, the latest victim is now seeking redress through the courts.

"This was my life savings that I lost," she said in a statement. "I can't even afford to pay my rent anymore."

In addition to seeking repayment from the perpetrators of the scam, she is also asking that EuroCasino be shut down permanently.

"This was a huge scam and it needs to be stopped," she said. "I don't want anyone else to lose their hard-earned money like this."

#  EuroCasino payout delay leaves sportsbooks in hot water

European Union lawmakers are looking to put an end to payout delays by online casinos, but the proposed changes may come too late for some sportsbooks.

According to a report from iGamingBusiness, the European Parliament is drafting new rules that would require online casinos to pay out winning bets within 24 hours. The proposal comes in response to complaints about payout delays by customers of EuroCasino, which is owned by the British Gambling Commission.

As currently drafted, the new rules would not take effect until after the Brexit transition period is over in January 2021. That’s too late for some sportsbooks that are struggling financially due to months-long payout delays by EuroCasino. One such bookmaker is Marathonbet, which has already announced plans to close its doors in November.

Marathonbet isn’t the only bookmaker feeling the heat from EuroCasino’s payout delays. Paddy Power Betfair, William Hill, and bet365 have all been forced to issue profit warnings due to the slow payouts at EuroCasino.

British Gambling Commission spokesman Neil McArthur told iGamingBusiness that the commission is working with other EU regulators to ensure that “the identified operators deliver on their commitments to consumers as soon as possible.” McArthur added that the commission is also considering “other measures which could be taken if there is evidence that these operators are not meeting their obligations to consumers.”

Even if the new EU rules take effect in January 2021, they may not be enough to save some of Europe’s smaller sportsbooks. Some industry insiders believe that many of these small bookmakers will file for bankruptcy if they don’t receive relief from EuroCasino’s payout delays soon.

#  Sports Betting Sites Struggle to Cope With EuroCasino Payouts

The European Court of Justice ruled this week that online gambling companies must pay out winnings within 14 days, a move that is set to cause problems for the betting industry.

Sports betting sites are struggling to cope with the new ruling, as they say it is impossible to guarantee payouts within such a short time frame. The Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association (GBGA) has warned that the ruling could lead to widespread closures in the gambling industry, with many small companies likely to go out of business.

The GBGA said in a statement: "This judgment will have serious consequences not just for the gambling industry in Gibraltar but throughout Europe as it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for operators to meet the required timescales without putting at risk vital consumer protections such as responsible gaming measures and player protection."

The court's decision is a response to a complaint made by a Portuguese player, who said he had not been paid his winnings from EuroCasino within the required 14-day period. The ruling will apply to all online gambling companies operating in the European Union, including UK-based firms.

Online gambling companies reacted angrily to the court's decision, with Ian Proctor, CEO of Sportingbet, calling it "crazy" and warning that it would lead to job losses. He said: "This ruling is ludicrous and goes against all common sense. It will force bookmakers across Europe out of business and cost thousands of jobs."

However, other observers have welcomed the court's decision, saying it will protect consumers and ensure that they receive their winnings promptly. Antony Seeley of Regulus Partners said: "It is good news for consumers that they will now get their money more quickly when they win online casino games. This should help reduce any potential fraud or financial instability in this burgeoning sector of the economy."

#  Casino Says It Will Reach Out to Affected Bettors Regarding EuroCasino Payouts

EuroCasino has said that it will be reaching out to affected bettors following a system outage that left some players unable to withdraw funds from the site.

"We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused and we are doing everything we can to get the system back up and running as soon as possible," a spokesperson for the casino said in a statement. "In the meantime, we will be in touch with all affected players to help them with their withdrawals."

The spokesperson did not say how long it would take for EuroCasino's systems to be back up and running or how many players were affected. The website's terms and conditions say that "in cases of force majeure, malfunction of our software or hardware, Strike, National Emergency, War etc., We reserve the right to keep all monies deposited by you at our casinos."

Some players were critical of EuroCasino on social media following the outage. "This is ridiculous," one player wrote on Twitter. "I've been waiting two weeks for a payout that was approved."

"This is unacceptable," another player wrote. "I have over $1,000 stuck in this casino."

It is unclear if EuroCasino will be compensating players for the inconvenience caused by the outage.
