#  PA Bahçeşehir Koleji referendum fails to pass

The referendum for the establishment of PA Bahçeşehir Koleji, a new private school in Istanbul, has failed to pass, according to unofficial results.

The “Yes” vote garnered only 49.76% of the vote, falling just short of the 50%+1 threshold required for a successful referendum.

The proposed school would have been located in Istanbul’s Bahçeşehir district and would have served students from Kindergarten through 12th grade. It was estimated that the new school would have cost around TRY 225 million (USD 63 million) to construct.

Supporters of the proposed school argued that it would have provided much-needed educational options for parents in the area. Detractors countered that there are already too many schools in Istanbul and that this particular school would have catered to wealthy families.

#  Gambling referendum fails in PA Bahçeşehir Koleji

Pennsylvania's referendum on gambling failed to pass on Tuesday, as voters rejected expanding casino-style gambling to the state.

The referendum would have allowed slot machines at 14 airports and racetracks, as well as legalizing internet gambling and daily fantasy sports. The vote was seen as a key test of whether to expand gambling in the United States.

Despite heavy campaigning from proponents of the referendum, including the casinos themselves, the measure was defeated by a wide margin. With almost all precincts reporting, 57% of voters had opposed the measure.

Casino magnates Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn had pumped millions of dollars into the "No" campaign, arguing that more gambling would lead to addiction and social problems.

Proponents of the referendum argued that it would create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for Pennsylvania schools and other services. They also said that it would keep gamblers in the state rather than spending their money elsewhere.

#  Bahçeşehir Koleji students vote against gambling referendum

On Sunday, April 1, Bahçeşehir Koleji students voted against the government’s proposed gambling referendum. The referendum would have allowed casinos to be opened in Turkey.

The Bahçeşehir Koleji student body is incredibly diverse, with students from all over the world. This diversity was on full display as students passionately debated the pros and cons of the referendum. In the end, the majority of students voted against the proposed amendment.

This is a major victory for Turkish youth and for democracy. Turkish youth have shown that they are not afraid to stand up to the government and demand their voices be heard. This referendum would have had a devastating impact on Turkish society, and the Bahçeşehir Koleji students can be proud of themselves for standing up against it.

This victory is also a sign of hope for Turkish democracy. The fact that a majority of Turkish youth voted against this amendment shows that they are willing to fight for their rights and democratic values. The Turkish government should take notice and realize that they cannot simply ignore the desires of the people.

Congratulations to all Bahçeşehir Koleji students who stood up against this referendum! You have made your voices heard and shown that you are ready to fight for democracy and justice in Turkey.

#  No gambling in PA Bahçeşehir Koleji

The Pennsylvania Bahçeşehir Koleji has announced that it will be prohibiting all gambling on its campus. This includes all forms of gambling, such as casino games, lotteries, and betting.

This policy is in line with the school’s values and mission. The school believes that gambling can have a negative impact on students’ academic performance and personal lives.

Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial instability and other problems. It can also cause conflict between students and damage the school’s reputation.

The Bahçeşehir Koleji is one of the top schools in Turkey and is known for its academic excellence. It is important for the school to maintain a positive image and provide a healthy learning environment for its students.

#  Gambling referendum denied in PA Bahçeşehir Koleji
Simulations gambling referendum was denied in Pennsylvania. The decision on the petition for the legalization of gambling on election day was postponed by the court to February 26, 2019.
The Commonwealth Court in Harrisburg ruled that the language of the referendum question does not meet state constitutional requirements. 
So far, this is the third attempt to legalize gambling in Pennsylvania. Previous proposals were rejected in 2017 and 2018.
Sponsors of the petition said they will appeal the ruling.
Pennsylvania is one of six states without any form of legalized gambling. There are more than 1,500 slot machines and 180 table games at casinos in Pennsylvania. Gambling proponents argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents say it would increase addiction rates and lead to other social problems.
