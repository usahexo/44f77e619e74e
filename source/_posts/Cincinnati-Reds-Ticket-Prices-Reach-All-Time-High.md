#  Cincinnati Reds Ticket Prices Reach All-Time High

The Cincinnati Reds have reached an all-time high for ticket prices, according to a report from SeatGeek. The average resale price for a game at Great American Ball Park is now $133, up from $85 last year.

This makes the Reds the eighth most expensive team in baseball, just ahead of the Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox. Interestingly, the Reds had the cheapest average ticket prices in baseball as recently as 2016.

What’s behind the dramatic increase? It’s likely a combination of factors, including the resurgence of the team in recent years and increased demand from fans. The Reds made it to the playoffs in both 2012 and 2013, and they currently sit in first place in the National League Central Division.

In addition, demand for tickets has grown as the team has made it a priority to improve its fan experience at Great American Ball Park. This includes amenities like upgraded food options, a new video board, and more social spaces throughout the stadium.

If you’re looking to go to a game at Great American Ball Park this year, be prepared to pay top dollar. But it may be worth it – with the Reds playing well and offering a great fan experience, this could be your chance to see them win their first World Series title since 1990.

#  Cincinnati Reds Tickets The Most Expensive In Baseball

The Cincinnati Reds tickets are the most expensive in all of baseball, according to a recent study by SeatGeek. The average ticket price for a game at Great American Ballpark is $101, which is more than any other team in baseball. This price is up 12% from last year, when the average ticket price was $90.

This news may come as a surprise to some, as the Reds finished in last place in the National League Central Division last year with a record of 67-95. However, the Reds have one of the most loyal fan bases in all of baseball, and demand for tickets remains high.

The Reds aren't the only team with high prices this year. The average ticket price for a game at Fenway Park in Boston is now $131, up 9% from last year. The Yankees have the second highest average ticket price at $114, followed by the Dodgers at $111.

The Mets have the cheapest tickets in baseball this year, with an average price of just $32. That's down 2% from last year's average price of $33. The Pirates and Rays both have average ticket prices of less than $40 this year.

#  Red's Tickets More Expensive Than Yankees, Cubs

The average price for a ticket to a game at Yankee Stadium is $53, while the average price for a ticket to a game at Wrigley Field is $48. However, tickets for games at Red Sox Park are unsurprisingly more expensive, with an average price of $59.

This most recent season has seen the Yankees and Cubs advance to the playoffs, while the Red Sox finished in last place in their division. The higher demand for tickets to see these popular teams may account for some of the increase in prices, but it is still interesting to note that tickets to see the Red Sox are more expensive on average than tickets to see other teams in MLB.

It will be interesting to see if this trend persists in future seasons, or if the Red Sox are able to bring down the cost of their tickets. In the meantime, if you’re looking to see a game at Fenway Park, be prepared to pay a little bit more than average.

#  Cincinnati Reds See Ticket Price Increase For Third Consecutive Year

The Cincinnati Reds will see a ticket price increase for the third consecutive year, as the team looks to rebound from a disappointing 2017 season.

The average ticket price for 2018 will be $27.39, up from $25.83 in 2017 and $23.81 in 2016. This marks the first time that ticket prices have increased three years in a row since the team moved to Great American Ballpark in 2003.

"We understand that fans are anxious to see this team rebound," said Reds Chief Operating Officer Phil Castellini. "And we're doing everything possible to put a winning product on the field."

Castellini also pointed to the Reds' investment in player development, including adding a new training facility and upgrading their Dominican Academy, as key reasons for the price hike.

#  Cincinnati Reds Tickets A Hot Commodity As Season Approaches

The Cincinnati Reds ticket demand is heating up as the days count down to Opening Day and the anticipation of another successful Reds season builds. Cincinnati fans are excited about their team’s chances this year and they are making their intentions known by snatching up tickets at a rapid pace.

As of March 14th, the average purchase price for individual game tickets on the secondary market was $101, according to TicketIQ. This represents a 9% premium over the team’s season average during the last two years. The get-in price for most games is $25, meaning that fans are willing to pay a significant amount to see their team in action.

The Reds will likely be a contender in the National League Central Division once again this year, so it is not surprising that demand for tickets is high. The team finished second in the division last year with an 88-74 record, just four games behind the World Champion Chicago Cubs. They have made a few key additions in the offseason, including starting pitcher Sonny Gray and outfielder Jesse Winker, and appear poised to make a run at the playoffs.

If you are looking to buy Cincinnati Reds tickets on the secondary market, now is definitely the time to do so. Prices will continue to rise as we get closer to Opening Day and sell out games become more likely. So don’t wait – get your tickets today!
