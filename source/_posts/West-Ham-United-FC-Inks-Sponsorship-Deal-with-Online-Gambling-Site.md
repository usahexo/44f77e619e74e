#  West Ham United FC Inks Sponsorship Deal with Online Gambling Site

West Ham United FC has announced a new sponsorship deal with an online gambling site. The agreement is reportedly worth £10 million per season and will run for three years.

The gambling site is set to become the club’s official betting partner, with its logo appearing on the front of West Ham’s shirts starting with the upcoming Premier League season. The deal is seen as a major coup for the site, as it looks to increase its profile and attractiveness to customers.

West Ham United FC has been searching for a new shirt sponsor since its previous deal with British Airways expired at the end of last season. The club had been in negotiations with several companies, but ultimately chose to sign with the gambling site.

“We are extremely pleased to have reached this agreement with [the gambling site],” said Karren Brady, Vice Chairman of West Ham United FC. “They are a forward-thinking company that shares our ambitions and values, and we are very excited to be working together from the start of the new Premier League season.”

The sponsorship deal is not without its controversy, however. Some lawmakers and anti-gambling groups have spoken out against it, arguing that it could lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling. They argue that it would be better for West Ham United FC to find a sponsor that is not associated with gambling.

However, supporters of the sponsorship deal say that it is a sensible move by the club, given the amount of money that is now being generated by online gambling. They argue that it is important for West Ham United FC to tap into this market and that the sponsorship deal will help them do just that.

#  West Ham United FC Brings in New Bookmaker for Next Season

One of the most popular football clubs in London, West Ham United FC, has announced a new partnership with a leading online bookmaker for the next season.

The club’s chief commercial officer, Richard Esplen, said that the new arrangement will provide West Ham fans with an enhanced betting experience. He added that the bookmaker is one of the most innovative in the market and that its products will be of great benefit to supporters.

At present, it is not clear which bookmaker has been chosen by West Ham United FC. However, it is known that the company is one of the biggest in Europe and has a strong presence in the UK.

The decision to sign up with a new bookmaker comes after West Ham’s previous partner decided to end its agreement with the club. This means that the team will have to look for a new provider ahead of the new Premier League season.

West Ham United FC is not alone in making this decision; several other Premier League clubs have also announced similar partnerships in recent weeks. This suggests that there is a growing trend among top-flight teams to form agreements with betting firms.

It is believed that this move is beneficial for both parties involved. For clubs, it provides an additional revenue stream, while for bookmakers, it allows them to tap into the massive fanbase of Premier League teams.
